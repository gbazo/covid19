EDA analysis and time series forecasting to explore new Covid-19 in Brazil.

According to wikipedia:

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and dry cough, whereas the American CDC says to watch for fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are less common. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is estimated to be 3.4% but varies by age and other health conditions.

In Brazil, the first case was identified on February 26 and according to the Ministry of Health report (03/16) there are 234 cases and zero deaths.

The purpose of the analyzes is to share data and generate new insights.

This was made possible thanks to data collection and database sharing.

All national information is being reported on the IVIS Platform:
